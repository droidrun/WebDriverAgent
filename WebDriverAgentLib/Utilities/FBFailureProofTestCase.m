 Automation failures (e.g. accessibility snapshot timeouts on unresponsive applications,
 surfaced through XCUIAutomation's _XCUIFailWithError) bypass recordIssue: completely:
 they are routed through handleIssue: -> _handleIssue:, which records the failure on the
 test case run and then calls this method to interrupt the test. When the never-ending
 server test spins a nested run loop, the default implementation sets
 shouldHaltWhenReceivesControl unconditionally (it does NOT consult
 shouldSetShouldHaltWhenReceivesControl), so the test would be interrupted with
 _XCTestCaseInterruptionException as soon as the nested run loop exits. The server must
 stay alive no matter what, thus the interruption request is suppressed.
