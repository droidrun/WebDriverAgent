# ReplayKit Broadcast Extension

WebDriverAgent embeds a ReplayKit **broadcast upload extension**
(`WebDriverAgentBroadcast.appex`) into the generated
`WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app`. When a broadcast is running, the extension receives the
system's screen frames as pixel buffers (up to 60 fps, no polling), encodes them with one
hardware H.264/H.265 encoder per capture session and ships the elementary stream to WDA over
a loopback TCP connection. `/mobilerun/screencapture` sessions then serve those frames instead
of the XCTest screenshot loop, raising the achievable frame rate from ~10-20 fps to 30-60 fps.

The extension only works on **physical iOS devices** (ReplayKit broadcasts are unavailable on
the Simulator and tvOS). Without a running broadcast every capture session transparently uses
the legacy screenshot pipeline; each session reports its current origin via the `source` field
(`"replaykit"` or `"screenshot"`).

## HTTP endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/mobilerun/screencapture/broadcast/start` | POST | Starts a system broadcast targeting the bundled extension. Foregrounds the runner app, triggers `RPSystemBroadcastPickerView` and confirms the system sheet via UI automation, then waits for the extension to connect. Idempotent while connected. |
| `/mobilerun/screencapture/broadcast` | GET | Broadcast status: `state` (`idle`/`connected`/`paused`), control port, extension id, last heartbeat (frames received, orientation, screen size) and the capture sessions with their active `source`. |
| `/mobilerun/screencapture/broadcast/stop` | POST | Asks the extension to finish the broadcast. Live sessions fall back to the screenshot source with a forced key frame; clients do not need to reconnect. Also accepts `dismissButtonLabels` (see below); it proactively clears the "Screen Broadcasting" alert after stopping. |

`broadcast/start` body (all optional):

```json
{
  "timeout": 30,
  "confirmButtonLabels": ["Start Broadcast"],
  "dismissButtonLabels": ["OK"],
  "restoreForegroundApp": true
}
```

- `timeout` — seconds to wait for the extension to connect (covers the system's 3-2-1 countdown).
- `confirmButtonLabels` — labels to look for on the system confirmation sheet. Pass the
  localized label when the device language is not English (a button starting with "Start" is
  used as fallback).
- `dismissButtonLabels` — labels of the button that dismisses the system's "Screen Broadcasting"
  alert left behind by a previous broadcast's end (SpringBoard posts this on iOS 26 whenever a
  broadcast terminates, and it otherwise blocks the picker dance). Defaults to `["OK"]`. Pass the
  localized label when the device language is not English. Also accepted by `broadcast/stop`.
- `restoreForegroundApp` — re-activate the previously active app after the broadcast starts
  (the start dance briefly foregrounds the runner app, ~2-3 s).

Notes:

- `/mobilerun/screencapture/start` never starts a broadcast by itself. Sessions started while
  the broadcast is connected attach to it automatically; sessions started before it pick it up
  on the extension's first key frame.
- Broadcasts started manually from Control Center attach exactly the same way (WDA listens
  permanently).
- If the broadcast stops (endpoint, status-bar pill, extension crash), sessions revert to the
  screenshot source within ~6 s (heartbeat staleness) without dropping client connections.
- Frames are encoded in the native ReplayKit orientation (not rotated upright like the
  screenshot path). The current `orientation` (CGImagePropertyOrientation 1-8) is exposed via
  the status endpoint and heartbeat.
- ReplayKit only delivers frames while the screen changes; the extension re-encodes the last
  frame to fill delivery gaps, so the stream holds the session's requested fps on static
  screens too (`repeated` counter in the heartbeat).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BROADCAST_CONTROL_PORT` | `9300` | Loopback port WDA listens on for the extension. The extension always connects to the compile-time default, so overriding this requires rebuilding the extension with a matching `FBBroadcastDefaultControlPort`. |
| `BROADCAST_EXT_BUNDLE_ID` | `<runner bundle id>.broadcast` | Bundle id preselected in the broadcast picker. Only needed if a re-signing pipeline renames the appex. |

## Build integration

- The `WebDriverAgentBroadcast` target is a dependency of `WebDriverAgentRunner`, so any
  scheme-based build (`xcodebuild build-for-testing -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner`, Fastlane,
  the npm bundle scripts) builds the appex into `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR`.
- A scheme **build post-action** (`Scripts/embed-broadcast-extension.sh`) copies the appex
  into `Runner.app/PlugIns/`, rewrites its `CFBundleIdentifier` to
  `<Runner.app CFBundleIdentifier>.broadcast` (the host id gets the `.xctrunner` suffix and may
  be overridden by downstream tooling, so it is derived at embed time) and re-signs
  inner-first. Post-actions run for scheme-based command-line builds too — the same mechanism
  that embeds the runner icon today.
- Builds that bypass the scheme (`xcodebuild -target ...`) must run the embed step manually:

  ```bash
  BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR=<products dir> PRODUCT_NAME=WebDriverAgentRunner \
    Scripts/embed-broadcast-extension.sh
  ```

## Re-signing (device farms / prebuilt WDA)

Pipelines that re-sign `WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app` must keep the nested appex valid:

1. Sign `PlugIns/WebDriverAgentBroadcast.appex` first with the **same team/identity** as the
   app (or use `codesign --deep` on the app, which handles nesting). Signing the outer app does
   not invalidate an already-valid nested signature.
2. The appex `CFBundleIdentifier` must remain `<host CFBundleIdentifier>.broadcast` — installd
   rejects extensions whose bundle id is not prefixed by the host app's, or whose team differs.
   If the pipeline changes the runner's bundle id, patch the appex id accordingly (the embed
   script shows how) and set `BROADCAST_EXT_BUNDLE_ID` if the suffix differs. The signed
   entitlements' `application-identifier` must match the (new) bundle id — when the embed
   script rewrites the id it regenerates that entitlement automatically; custom re-signers
   must do the same.
3. Provisioning: the embedded profile must cover the appex bundle id; a wildcard development
   profile (`TEAM.*`) is the low-friction option. The extension needs no special entitlements
   (no app groups — IPC is loopback TCP).

```

The wire protocol (16-byte framed messages, JSON control payloads, binary video/audio frames)
is defined in `WebDriverAgentLib/Utilities/FBBroadcastProtocol.h`, which is compiled into both
the framework and the extension.

## Audio capture

While a broadcast is running the extension also receives the device's **app audio**
(`RPSampleBufferTypeAudioApp`; microphone audio is intentionally ignored) and serves it to
`/mobilerun/audiocapture` sessions (see
[mobilerun-audiocapture.md](mobilerun-audiocapture.md)):

- One `FBExtAudioPipeline` per audio session converts the incoming PCM (typically 44.1 kHz)
  to 48 kHz and encodes 20 ms (960-sample) **Opus** packets with AudioToolbox's
  `AudioConverter` — no third-party codec is bundled.
- Audio sessions use the same SESSION_ADD/SESSION_REMOVE control messages as video ones,
  discriminated by a `media: "audio"` JSON key and **bit 31 of the wire session id**
  (`FBBroadcastAudioSessionIdFlag`), so audio and video ids never collide on the shared
  connection.
- The extension sends `AUDIO_PARAMS` (`0x87`, the RFC 7845 `OpusHead` with the encoder's real
  pre-skip) and `AUDIO_FRAME` (`0x88`, `[8B pts µs BE][one Opus packet]`) messages; WDA fans
  the packets out to the session's TCP clients.
- Audio has **no screenshot-style fallback**: sessions stay alive without a broadcast but
  stream nothing (`streaming: false` in the session object) until the extension connects.
- The heartbeat carries an `audioPipelines` block (`samplesIn`, `packetsEncoded`,
  `ringFrames`, … plus per-second rates) next to the video `pipelines` block.
